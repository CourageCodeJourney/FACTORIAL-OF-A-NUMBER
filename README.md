# FACTORIAL-OF-A-NUMBER
The program prompts the user for an integer input. If it's negative, an error message displays. For 0, the factorial is 1. For positive integers, a for loop iterates from 1 to the inputted number, multiplying each number to calculate the factorial stored in the 'fact' variable.
